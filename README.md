## Introduction
After hours of work, here is my homework assignment! 

## Resources
I am most likely forgetting a few since I jumped around and Googled a lot. Here are thoes that I do recall:

* For help understandinf functions (especially expressions) and parameters
	* [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)
	* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_invocation.asp)
* For praciting and comparing others notes through their forums
	* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) 
* For president information
	*   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States)

*Not listed are the notes and lectures I reviewed multiple times*   

## Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
Like last homework, this was an interesting test to make sure we're leaning JavaScript and Git. This took much longer than I expected, and probably has a bunch of errors. Guess that means more lecture reviewing, YouTube and Google searches, and some of the other links that are available to us.

I also messed up and had to quickly redo it...
